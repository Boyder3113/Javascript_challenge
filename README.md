<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

How many UFO's have visited Earth? The answer is at least one!

With the code in this respository you can learn about every UFO visit to earth via a local hosted JavaScript based website.
Run the index.html file to gain access to a local database loaded into a JavaScript table which can be filtered by either date or location(city) of the UFO siting.
If a new siting occurs just add it to the data.js file to have it automatically appended to the website table.

Keep watching the skies!
